<h3>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop (L5V-00001)</h3>
<p>This set of complex modifications provides macOS-friendly customizations to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/8xk02kz6k69w" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop (L5V-00001)</a>.</p>

<h4>Customizations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Swaps the Option keys and the Command keys so that their arrangement matches that of Apple keyboards.</li>
  <li>Maps the top row of keys as controls for similar, built-in macOS features.</li>
  <li>Maps the 'Back' mouse button to the 'Back' action.</li>
  <li>Maps the Windows mouse button to launching 'Launchpad.app'.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<h5>Toggle Fn Switch on Keyboard</h5>
<p>Move the Fn toggle on Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard to the blue position so that the top row of keys work as controls for built-in macOS features.</p>

<h5>Change Top Row of Keys to Work as Standard Function Keys</h5>
<p>This puts Karabiner-Elements (as opposed to macOS) in charge of mapping key codes to controls for built-in macOS features. This also disables the default 'Function keys' mappings shipped with Karabiner-Elements so that customizations would not be overriden down the <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/manual/misc/event-modification-chaining/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Input Event Modification Chain</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose Apple menu ï£¿ > System Preferences.</li>
  <li>Click Keyboard.</li>
  <li>Select "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys".</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The 'Home' key (F1 key) and the 'Calculator' key are impossible to map. This is due to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/317548/how-do-i-get-the-calculator-button-on-a-microsoft-sculpt-keyboard-working" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">macOS not being able to receive the scancodes from these keys</a>.</li>
  <li>Media playback control keys do not need special treatments as they work out of the box.</li>
</ul>
