<h4>Usage notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There's two keys that are impossible to map, the Calculator key and the Media Player key.</li>
  <li>Volume and media playback buttons work out of the box.</li>
  <li>I wish the Application key wasn't there, but since it's there I mapped it to the Cmd key, which means both the Application and Window key work as the same.</li>
  <li>It is important to load the Emoji remapping first and then the O365 button one, otherwise the emoji button will behave differently and just open the Spotlight.</li>
  <li>Feel free to manually modify any of the mappings to match personal preference.</li>
</ul>
